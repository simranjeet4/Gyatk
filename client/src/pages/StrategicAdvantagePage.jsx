              RVCR mechanism-based products require high end engineering competencies and Industrial technological base. The stake-holders here are vested in large Industrious facilities built and perfected over generations. The technological leadership here is legacy of business and engineering process refinement through time. Many of them trace back these legacies to the industrial revolution. Hence its nearly impossible to catchup the leader by chasing strategies. By the time one builds competencies the leader has already mover ahead. The only way possible is to leapfrog ahead of the leader with new concept technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The in-cycle investments in existing project and deep entrenchments in existing facilities are a major retardant for Industry majors. However, their urge for continued leadership is also formidable. Hence RVCR is an opportunity for both the existing leaders and new ambitious players.
